# CoffeeRunHW5

This uses a firebase FIRESTORE, in order to view database changes the firestore would need to be remade locally
Create a new firebase project, go to project settings and add a new web app, replace the existing firebaseconfig (located in index.html) with the new supplied config.
In the firestore of the new project create a new collection called "coffeeorders".

All the data will be added as documents to the collection with fields containing the stored data.
